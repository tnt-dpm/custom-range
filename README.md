# Mango Range

## Description
Mango Range is a React + TypeScript component demo that implements a dualâ€‘thumb range selector. It supports stepped ranges via `step` and fixed value sets via `options`, keeps thumbs within bounds, and exposes an `onChange` callback. The project includes a simple router-based layout and SCSS styling.
